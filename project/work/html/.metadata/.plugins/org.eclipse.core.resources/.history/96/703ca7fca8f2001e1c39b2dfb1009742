            <h2>A Minor Bird</h2>
            <p>
                I have wished a bird would fly away,<br>
                And not sing by my house all day;<br><br>
                Have clapped my hands at him from the door,<br>
                When it seemed as if I could bear no more.<br><br>
                The fault must partly have been in me.<br>
                The bird was not to blame for his key.<br><br>
                And of course there must be something wrong,<br>
                In wanting to silence any song.

            <h2>The Year</h2>
            <p>
                What can be said in New Year rhymes,<br>
                That’s not been said a thousand times?<br><br>
                The new years come, the old years go,<br>
                We know we dream, we dream we know.<br><br>
                We rise up laughing with the light,<br>
                We lie down weeping with the night.<br><br>
                We hug the world until it stings,<br>
                We curse it then and sigh for wings.<br><br>
                We live, we love, we woo, we wed,<br>
                We wreathe our brides, we sheet our dead.<br><br>
                We laugh, we weep, we hope, we fear,<br>
                And that’s the burden of the year.
